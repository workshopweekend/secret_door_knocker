+ [1 Arduino](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021). We use the Arduino Uno, but any standard Arduino is appropriate for this project.
+ [1 breadboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12002).
+ [1 servo](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9347). You'll want to explore different servo options to get the one that best suits what you're looking for -- some servos are more powerful than others!
+ [1 red LED](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9590).
+ [1 green LED](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9650).
+ [1 tactile button](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9190). Any push-button switch will do! This button will let us re-program a new knocking sequence.
+ [1 piezo transducer](http://www.oddwires.com/piezo-element-multicomp-g2310-4128-with-mounting-holes/). You'll use this to detect knocks.
+ [1 1M Ω resistor]
+ [1 1K to 10K Ω resistor]
+ [Wires](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9194) for wiring.
